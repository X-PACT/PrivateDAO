# Patent Evaluation Brief

This file is a counsel-ready technical brief for patentability review.
It is not legal advice.

## Candidate Subject Matter

- Privacy-preserving commit-reveal governance for DAOs
- Combined governance controls:
  - hidden tally during voting
  - reveal verification bound to voter pubkey
  - timelocked treasury execution
  - optional dual-chamber thresholding

## Current Public Disclosure Status

- Source code is publicly available in this repository.
- Devnet deployment is public.
- Public disclosure can affect patent rights depending on jurisdiction and timing.

## Novelty Evidence to Prepare

- Earliest authored commits for protocol logic
- Earliest deployment slot and program id evidence
- Architectural documents and test proofs
- Competitor comparison table with concrete distinctions

## Prior Art Review Inputs

Counsel/agent should evaluate:

- Existing DAO governance patents and applications
- Prior open-source governance frameworks
- Known commit-reveal systems in governance and adjacent domains

## Enforcement Realism

- Patent strategy is high-cost and jurisdiction-specific.
- If novelty is weak, prioritize trademark + private service moat + brand execution.

## Action Plan

1. Export evidence pack via `scripts/ip/generate-evidence-pack.sh`.
2. Book consultation with an IP patent attorney.
3. Share this brief, architecture notes, and repository commit history.
4. Decide whether to proceed with provisional/non-provisional strategy.
