# Trademark Filing Preparation Pack

This file is a filing-prep checklist for the project owner.
It is not legal advice.

## Owner

- Name: Eslam Kotb (X-PACT)
- Project mark: PrivateDAO
- Jurisdiction target: United States (primary), then expansion as needed

## What to Register

- Word mark: `PrivateDAO`
- Logo mark: logo files in `docs/assets/`
- Optional composite mark: `PrivateDAO by X-PACT`

## Goods/Services Positioning Draft

- Downloadable software for blockchain governance
- Software-as-a-service for DAO governance workflows
- Open-source governance tooling and developer utilities

## Evidence Package (Proof of First Use)

Collect and archive:

- Git history proving authorship and timeline
- Devnet deployment proof (program id + slot + explorer link)
- Public product page screenshots (`docs/index.html`, GitHub Pages)
- Release tags and changelog entries
- Any public announcements with date proof

Generate a local evidence pack with:

```bash
bash scripts/ip/generate-evidence-pack.sh
```

## Filing Sequence

1. Run an availability search for confusingly similar marks.
2. Finalize exact mark owner entity (individual vs company).
3. Choose filing basis and services wording with counsel.
4. File word mark first, then logo mark.
5. Store filing receipts and docket dates under `LEGAL/records/`.

## Post-Filing Controls

- Use consistent mark formatting: `PrivateDAO`.
- Keep `TRADEMARKS.md` and `IP_POLICY.md` aligned with filings.
- Monitor marketplace/repo misuse and issue takedown notices when needed.
