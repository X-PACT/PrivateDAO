# PrivateDAO — Final Submission Draft

## One-line Summary

PrivateDAO is a Solana governance and treasury product that combines private voting, `zk_enforced` hardening, confidential payroll and bonus approvals, and execution-safe treasury operations in one live Devnet system.

## The Problem

Most DAO voting is public the moment it is cast. That creates three practical failures:

- whale intimidation because smaller voters react to visible large wallets
- vote buying because the live tally can be watched and manipulated
- treasury signaling because markets can front-run visible governance momentum

This is not just a UX problem. It is a protocol problem.

## The Solution

PrivateDAO uses a governed operating flow:

1. `commit`
   voters submit `sha256(vote || salt || voter_pubkey)` so the vote is binding but hidden
2. `reveal`
   voters or authorized keepers reveal `(vote, salt)` after voting closes
3. `finalize + execute`
   result is finalized after reveal, and treasury execution is delayed behind an explicit timelock
4. `confidential operations`
   payout proposals can attach encrypted payroll or bonus manifests, REFHE evaluation envelopes, and MagicBlock private payment corridors before aggregate settlement

## Why It Matters On Solana

Solana has strong DAO, wallet, and infra tooling, but governance privacy is still weak in most practical flows. PrivateDAO focuses on one painful gap and solves it in a way that is compatible with real operator workflows instead of inventing a fantasy governance stack from scratch.

## What Works Today

- deployed devnet program
- live wallet-connected frontend
- commit-reveal governance
- proposal-level `zk_enforced` mode with on-chain receipts
- token-weighted, quadratic, and dual-chamber voting modes
- timelocked execution
- treasury `SendSol` execution
- treasury `SendToken` execution with mint and ownership checks
- private delegation per proposal
- keeper-assisted reveal
- confidential payroll and bonus approvals
- REFHE proposal-bound evaluation envelopes
- MagicBlock private payment corridors for confidential token payouts
- backend read node / indexer path with runtime diagnostics
- Realms-oriented migration path
- operator CLI flows for create, commit, reveal, finalize, execute, deposit, migration, corridor settlement, and proposal inspection

## Product Reality

This is a real Devnet beta product, not a slide deck and not an audited mainnet governance system.

The repository now includes:

- a live on-chain program
- a published frontend product surface
- backend read infrastructure
- confidential treasury operations
- CLI and migration tooling
- runtime diagnostics and reviewer artifacts
- TypeScript verification and generated attestation flows on the current project setup

## Security and Safety Highlights

- hidden tally during commit phase
- reveal only after commit phase closes
- finalize only after reveal window closes
- execute only after timelock
- no double execute
- no delegation double-use
- recipient validation for `SendSol`
- mint and token-account validation for `SendToken`
- proposal-bound confidential payout plans
- REFHE and MagicBlock settlement gating before sensitive token payout execution
- reviewer-visible runtime and go-live artifacts

## Why This Project Stands Out

- It solves a real governance and treasury operations pain point instead of repackaging generic DAO tooling.
- It is already structured like a product: program, frontend, backend read path, CLI, docs, runtime evidence, and operator workflow all line up.
- It extends privacy from voting into confidential compensation and treasury operations.
- It takes migration and operational review seriously instead of treating existing DAO state as disposable.
- It stays honest about scope, which makes the project more credible, not less.

## Current Deployment

- Program ID:
  `5AhUsbQ4mJ8Xh7QJEomuS85qGgmK9iNvFqzF669Y7Psx`
- Repository:

- Live frontend:

- Pitch video:

## Closing

PrivateDAO is not trying to claim that governance risk disappears forever.

It is making on-chain organizational operations meaningfully better on Solana:
private voting, confidential compensation, disciplined treasury execution, and reviewer-visible runtime trust.
