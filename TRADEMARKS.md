# Trademarks and Branding

PrivateDAO and X-PACT names, logos, and visual identifiers are reserved.

## No Trademark License

The repository source-code license does not grant trademark rights.
You may not use the project marks to market forks, hosted products, or services in a way that creates confusion about origin or endorsement.

## Restricted Without Permission

- Using official logos in a commercial product UI
- Naming a fork/product as "PrivateDAO" without clear separation
- Using branding in sales/marketing material as if official

## Allowed Nominative Use

You may reference the project name in factual contexts (research, comparisons, citations) as long as it is clear you are not the official project.

## Permission Requests

For branding/commercial permission, contact the project owner:

- Eslam Kotb (X-PACT)
