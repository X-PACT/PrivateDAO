# Verification Gates

PrivateDAO maintains a reviewer-visible verification layer so the repository can be checked without trusting prose alone.

## Core Gates

Run these from the repository root.

### Strategy Surface

```bash
npm run verify:strategy-surface
```

Checks that the strategy-facing review package is present and internally coherent.

### Submission Registry

```bash
npm run verify:submission-registry
```

Checks that the canonical submission registry contains the required packages, links, gates, and core identity values.

### Registry Consistency

```bash
npm run verify:registry-consistency
```

Checks that the submission registry and proof registry stay aligned on canonical live references.

### Generated Artifacts

```bash
npm run verify:generated-artifacts
```

Checks that generated reviewer artifacts such as the audit packet and review attestation exist and remain structurally valid.

### Devnet Stress Harness

```bash
npm run test:devnet:all
```

Runs the full 50-wallet Devnet harness, then rebuilds and verifies the reviewer artifacts that bind:

- wallet registry
- DAO bootstrap record
- explorer transaction registry
- adversarial rejection report
- zk proof registry
- performance metrics
- load-test report

This is the canonical reproducible multi-wallet execution command for the live Devnet package.

### Devnet Extended Isolation And Race Harness

```bash
npm run test:devnet:multi
npm run test:devnet:race
npm run test:devnet:extended
```

These commands extend the canonical 50-wallet run with:

- three live proposals executed in one DAO to prove proposal isolation
- cross-proposal voter-record and delegation-marker rejection evidence
- concurrent finalize races with one valid winner
- concurrent execute races with one valid winner

The generated reviewer-facing artifacts are:

- `docs/devnet-multi-proposal-report.json`
- `docs/devnet-multi-proposal-report.md`
- `docs/devnet-race-report.json`
- `docs/devnet-race-report.md`

### Cryptographic Integrity

```bash
npm run verify:cryptographic-manifest
```

Checks that the sha256 manifest covering zk artifacts, live-proof anchors, and generated review materials still matches the canonical files on disk.

### Mainnet Readiness Report

```bash
npm run build:mainnet-readiness-report
npm run verify:mainnet-readiness-report
```

Builds and verifies the generated readiness report that summarizes what is already verified inside the repository and what still remains external before any production cutover should be claimed.

### Deployment Attestation

```bash
npm run build:deployment-attestation
npm run verify:deployment-attestation
```

Builds and verifies a machine-readable deployment attestation that binds the canonical program, governance anchors, token surface, readiness status, and verification gates into one review artifact.

### Go-Live Attestation

```bash
npm run build:go-live-attestation
npm run verify:go-live-attestation
```

Builds and verifies a machine-readable go-live decision artifact that makes the current mainnet block conditions explicit instead of leaving them implicit in prose.

### Runtime Attestation

```bash
npm run build:runtime-attestation
npm run verify:runtime-attestation
```

Builds and verifies a machine-readable runtime summary for supported Devnet wallets, the diagnostics page, and the reviewer-visible wallet runtime surface.

### Runtime Surface

```bash
npm run verify:runtime-surface
```

Checks that the live diagnostics page, supported wallet labels, runtime attestation, and PDAO/runtime anchors stay aligned in the frontend itself.

### ZK Registry

```bash
npm run build:zk-registry
npm run verify:zk-registry
```

Builds and verifies the machine-readable registry for the live Circom and Groth16 stack, including artifact paths, public signal counts, and per-layer commands.

### ZK Transcript

```bash
npm run build:zk-transcript
npm run verify:zk-transcript
```

Builds and verifies the reviewer-readable zk transcript that carries the proving system, ptau reference, per-layer commands, and tracked artifact hashes.

### ZK Attestation

```bash
npm run build:zk-attestation
npm run verify:zk-attestation
```

Builds and verifies a machine-readable zk attestation that binds the registry, transcript, proving system, ptau, and per-layer proof artifacts into one reviewer-facing summary.

### ZK Docs

```bash
npm run verify:zk-docs
```

Checks that the zk reviewer docs stay aligned on layer names, replay boundaries, and verification commands.
This includes:

- threat extension
- assumption matrix
- capability matrix
- verification flow

### ZK Consistency And Tamper Rejection

```bash
npm run verify:zk-consistency
npm run verify:zk-negative
```

Checks that recomputed public signals match the stored outputs and that tampered public signals or proof objects are rejected.

### Live Proof

```bash
npm run verify:live-proof
```

Checks that the live-proof document stays aligned with the canonical proof registry and expected devnet evidence.

The wider review surface also tracks the documented Devnet governance-token profile:

- `docs/pdao-token.md`
- `docs/token.md`

### Token Presence Gate

The token presence gate confirms that governance identity and structured participation are visible in the reviewer surface.

This means the repository should make clear:

- why the governance token exists
- how it supports proposal participation
- how it reinforces lifecycle accountability
- how it fits inside the wider governance security model

### Release Manifest

```bash
npm run verify:release-manifest
```

Checks that the release manifest, proof registry, README references, and generated handoff surfaces remain consistent.

### Program ID Consistency

```bash
npm run verify:program-id-consistency
```

Checks that the canonical PrivateDAO program id stays aligned across `Anchor.toml`, `declare_id!`, reviewer docs, the frontend constant, and supporting tooling.

### PDAO Token Surface

```bash
npm run build:pdao-attestation
npm run verify:pdao-surface
npm run verify:pdao-attestation
npm run verify:pdao-live
```

Checks that the published PDAO token docs, local metadata asset, generated attestation, reviewer-facing surfaces, and live Devnet token state stay aligned with the canonical proof registry.

### Review Links

```bash
npm run verify:review-links
```

Checks that the canonical reviewer path remains visible from the README and the GitHub Pages frontend.

### Ops Surface

```bash
npm run verify:ops-surface
```

Checks that production-ops, incident-response, monitoring, cutover, and operator docs remain present.

### Review Surface

```bash
npm run verify:review-surface
```

Runs the broader review-surface gate, including release-manifest, live-proof, registry, and reviewer-link consistency.

## Unified Gate

```bash
npm run verify:all
```

This is the canonical repo-wide verification command. It rebuilds generated reviewer artifacts and runs the verification gates needed to keep the reviewer, operator, and proof surfaces coherent.

## CI Enforcement

The unified gate is also enforced in CI on push and pull request events, so review-surface drift is caught automatically.
